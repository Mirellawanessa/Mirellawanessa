# Mirella Wanessa  
**Senior Back-End Software Engineer | Cloud & Distributed Systems**

Back-End Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing, building, and operating high-performance, scalable microservices and APIs in distributed, cloud-native environments. I specialize in transforming complex technical requirements into resilient, maintainable systems grounded in strong engineering fundamentals such as **SOLID, Clean Architecture, Clean Code, and Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

**English: Full Professional Proficiency**

My background includes building event-driven architectures capable of processing **35,000+ events/hour** using **Apache Kafka**, as well as designing cost-efficient, scalable solutions on **AWS**, achieving **~20% reduction in operational costs** through optimized NoSQL data modeling and cloud-native architectural decisions.
